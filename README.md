1. Monthly Rent Distribution by Property Type

Visualize the distribution of monthly rent for each property type using box plots or violin plots to identify trends and outliers.

2. Relationship Between Number of Rooms and Monthly Rent

Use a scatter plot or bar chart to examine how the number of rooms correlates with monthly rent, segmented by property type or furnished status.

3. Facilities Analysis Across Property Types

Create a heatmap or bar chart to show the availability of facilities (e.g., swimming pool, parking, security) for different property types.

4. Impact of Furnishing on Monthly Rent

Compare the average monthly rent of fully furnished, partially furnished, and unfurnished properties using a bar chart or grouped violin plot.

5. Geographical Rent Trends by Location

Plot the monthly rent on a map or grouped by location (e.g., Cheras, Mont Kiara) to identify areas with higher or lower rent costs.
