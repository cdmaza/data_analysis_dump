 factors to own a game such as brand reputation, hype, features and the genre of the game, User did not bother to spend
 more to own a game that satisfies all their preference.

 user interest in sports, then the game that will played the most is sports game.

 are many negative reviews. It is due to review is based on personal preference. If one user did not like the game, it does
 not mean other will dislike it too.
